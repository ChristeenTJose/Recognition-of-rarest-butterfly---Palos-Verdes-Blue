## Problem Statement [2021 Updated]

Through this project I aim to build a deep learning model capable of recognising the species of a butterfly given an image or video feed, and to deploy the model as an online tool where users can upload their images and get the name of the species back. The project will also include building custom datasets for all the interested species. The dataset will consist of images of butterflies belonging to each of the interested species and will be used to train the neural network for recognition.

## Motivation

Butterflies are particularly sensitive to climate change. Scientists monitor butterflies for warning signs of climate change.

An example of these studies involves monitoring Edithâ€Ÿs checkerspot butterflies in North America. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the distribution of these butterflies has shifted further north and to higher elevations as the result of an increase in temperature.

Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) leave their summer breeding grounds in the northeastern U.S. and Canada and travel upwards of 3,000 miles to reach overwintering grounds in southwestern Mexico. But unlike birds or wildebeest that also embark on epic migrations, these individual butterflies will never return. As the days get shorter and the temperatures drop off, monarchs begin to abandon breeding and feeding territories in search of a safe place to spend the winter. For monarchs, that overwintering ground is found high up on just a few mountains in central Mexico. Once there, the monarchs huddle together by the millions on the branches of oyamel fir trees. A rise in avocado plantations taking over native forests has contributed to the monarch's decline.

In addition to being an indicator of climate change, butterflies are also sensitive to other threats such as habitat destruction. Changes in the behaviour of butterflies can warn people of the future effects of habitat loss on other animals.

## Project Outcome [2021 Updated]

1.	Website where users can upload images/video feeds and get back the species of the butterfly(s) present.
2.	Trained deep learning model that can recognise different butterfly species, particularly rare ones.
